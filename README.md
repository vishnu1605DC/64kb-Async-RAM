# 64KB Asynchronous RAM â€” UVM Verification Project

Successfully completed my first UVM-based verification project by designing and verifying a 64KB asynchronous RAM. This was a hands-on dive into UVM testbench development, with a deliberately simple DUT to help focus on building a robust verification environment from scratch.

ðŸš€ **Key Highlights:**
- Developed a fully functional UVM testbench with 7 custom sequences and 4 test cases to cover all DUT signal behaviors.
- Tackled the added challenge of verifying an async design â€” no clock signal, just clean logic!
- **Tools used:** QuestaSim & EDA Playground.

This project marked my first step into the world of UVM, and Iâ€™m thrilled that it worked perfectly! Looking forward to exploring more complex designs and leveling up with every project. ðŸ’ª
